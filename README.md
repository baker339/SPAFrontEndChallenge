# **Hello, Ally team!**

### **A little bit of background on what I am presenting here (Front End Edition).**
---

In this front end challenge, I focused entirely on creating
a responsive SPA form. The idea here was to create a form
that was both functional but also presented in a pleasing
and eas to understand manner. 

So, fields are chosen to best capture the correct data. Errors
thrown give meaningful feedback in order to correct them. And,
data pulls are quick to prevent long load times.

### **Where do I see gaps and what do I think could be expanded in the future?**
---

There are two main areas that would be necessary if this were
a real form to be used. 

*The Database*
If this data were to be meaningfully used in any way, it would
need to be captured somehow. I would imagine that any database
structures required for this would be quite minimal. 

*The API*
The API to connect to the database would be important for
two reasons. First, the answers given by the user need to be 
sent to the database to create new records. But also, there
is functionality framed out here in order to perform udpates. 
Those updates would need to be identifiable in some way and 
be able to match database data on some key. This way the data
can be later changed rather than a new record on every submission.

### **Remaining Questions?**
---

No remaining questions, but consumption of data remains a heavy
thought in my mind. I think this challenge was able to show a
capability to visually build a front SPA with user interactibility.
But, right now it is really just a front facing application. 

Luckily, with something like React, connecting to a data source
can be relatively simple, so there is nothing to worry about.
